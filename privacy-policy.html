    <h1>SemperClock Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 21, 2026</p>

    <p>SemperClock is built with your privacy in mind. This policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>

    <h2>Data That Stays on Your Devices</h2>
    <p>All workout data, exercise configurations, and results are stored locally on your device. SemperClock does not upload your personal data to any cloud service or third-party server. Your data is yours.</p>

    <h2>Heart Rate Data</h2>
    <p>SemperClock reads heart rate data from Apple Watch via HealthKit and from external Bluetooth heart rate monitors (such as the Polar H10). This data is used solely to display real-time heart rate during workouts and to calculate heart rate zone summaries in your results. Heart rate data is not stored beyond the workout session results on your device.</p>

    <h2>Bluetooth Connections</h2>
    <p>The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>External heart rate monitors</li>
        <li>Concept2 PM5 rowing machine monitors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These connections are used exclusively for real-time workout metrics. No data from these devices is transmitted off your local network.</p>

    <h2>Local Network Communication</h2>
    <p>When you use multi-device features (iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV), SemperClock communicates over your local Wi-Fi network using Apple's MultipeerConnectivity and WatchConnectivity frameworks. This data (workout state, heart rate, rowing metrics) travels only between your devices on your local network.</p>

    <h2>Remote Multiplayer</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the remote workout feature, SemperClock connects to a relay server to coordinate workouts with participants on other networks. The only data transmitted is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A display name you choose</li>
        <li>Device type (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV)</li>
        <li>Real-time workout state (heart rate, rowing metrics, workout progress)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is transient and is not stored on the relay server after the session ends. No account creation is required.</p>

    <h2>Microphone</h2>
    <p>SemperClock may request microphone access for voice command features during workouts. Audio is processed entirely on-device using Apple's Speech framework. No audio data is recorded, stored, or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
    <p>SemperClock does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. The app does not collect usage statistics, crash reports, or behavioral data beyond what Apple may collect through standard App Store mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>SemperClock does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in with any service.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SemperClock does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not collect personal information from any user.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/john-occasionally-blogs/semperclock">SemperClock GitHub repository</a>.</p>
