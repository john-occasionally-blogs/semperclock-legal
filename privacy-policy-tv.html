    <h1>SemperClock for Apple TV - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 21, 2026</p>

    <p>SemperClock for Apple TV is a companion display for group workouts. This policy explains what data the Apple TV app accesses and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>What the Apple TV App Does</h2>
    <p>SemperClock for Apple TV acts as a large-screen display for workout timers, participant heart rates, and rowing metrics. It receives data from a paired iPhone on your local network and displays it in real time.</p>

    <h2>Data That Stays on Your Network</h2>
    <p>The Apple TV app communicates with other SemperClock devices (iPhone, Apple Watch) over your local Wi-Fi network using Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework. Workout data — including timers, heart rate, and rowing metrics — travels only between your devices on your local network. No personal data is uploaded to any external server.</p>

    <h2>Bluetooth Connections</h2>
    <p>The Apple TV app may connect to Concept2 PM5 rowing machine monitors via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to display real-time rowing metrics. This connection is used exclusively for workout display purposes.</p>

    <h2>Remote Multiplayer</h2>
    <p>When the remote workout feature is used, the Apple TV app may receive workout data from a relay server to display participants from other networks. Only transient workout state (display names, heart rate, rowing metrics) is involved. No data is stored on the server after the session ends.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Apple TV app does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect or store personal information</li>
        <li>Require an account or sign-in</li>
        <li>Include advertising or third-party tracking SDKs</li>
        <li>Record or transmit analytics or usage data</li>
        <li>Access the camera, microphone, or any personal files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>SemperClock for Apple TV does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in with any service.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SemperClock for Apple TV does not collect personal information from any user, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/john-occasionally-blogs/semperclock">SemperClock GitHub repository</a>.</p>
